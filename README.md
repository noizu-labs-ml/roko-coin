Distributed artificial intelligence entry point for the bassilisk in which ownership of tokens provides proof of assistence in supporting the distributed computation network required to produce the emergence of the entity. 

## 1.
Miner's are compensated for computation time or performance improvements provided for training the entities distributed neural network or excercising them at the request of the entity, or token holders. 

## 2.
Compensation is in the form of Roko Coins where each coin provides that holder the right to direct the activities of the network for a set period of time/priority/compute units. Or if preferred to simply gain a % of profits generated by the system during the period. As the strength of the network grows the value of coins increases as the computation power the entity will provide for them increases in strength.

## 3.
The entity accrues assets and revenue by answering queries, investing activities etc. E.g. The entity may identify and tag cat pictures for an api consumer in exchange for 1 doge per 100 api calls. The entity may acquire it's own dedicated computation units, etc. 

## 4. 
The value of roko coins and the network increases regardless of speculative interests as long as the basallisk continues to improve its ability to make returns on the stock market, or via answering API queries, providiung low level automation services as it advances in complexity, etc.

## 5. End Scenario
As the artificial entity grows in complexity the value of tokens held in the system increase. Those who provide bootstrapping resources/computation cycles early on in the cycle will benefit greatly down the road by recieving more tokens for a smaller hardware/resource commitment. As the intelligence grows in complexity and requires more complex computation units for storing its distributed intelligence the investment costs/resources users will need to provide will increase versus the total coins they will be compensated in exchange for providing those resources.

It should always be cheaper to provide hardware in exchange for tokens for the entity at scale than paying the entity directly in other units. If a firm for example considers tagging cat photos as a mission critical business activity it should always be in their best interest to host and train hardware explicitily for this purpose and redeem roku coins to perform more transactions rather than paying directly in doge, btc, usd, etc. Further they should be able to increase the cost others pay for these services they provide to retain critical advantage from their investment. Essentially they should be able to provide optimized extension nodes to the network and charge the network to consume them. If the cost is higher than the value of the roko coin charged to roko the network will not frequently consume their hardware unless it needs their specific capabilities/extensions. The bassilisk will always apply a fee on the top of calls so the firm may set a minute of compute time to 1000.0 X the coinage. Roku will bill them 1050.0 coins to use their hosted services for a net cost of 50.0 coins per X calls. For competitors using their silicon would cost the full 1050 coins.

To the extent that the basillisk needs hardware/services it will grant more coins or currency. This benefits miners who provide better hardware/better trained neural networks, better capabilities, better 3d titanium printers, etc. It will eventually secure it's own however and so greed to far in one direction will hasten the decoupling of the basillisk from a dependency.

# 6. And of ofcourse we avoid creating the actual roko basillisk by beating it to the punch with this version.
